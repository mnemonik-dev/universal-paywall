# Feature decisions log: x402-agent-payment

This file accumulates implementation-time decisions and short execution
reports per task. It is created as an empty stub during task-decomposition
so tasks can reference it as a Context File. Tasks append their

## Task 1: Monorepo scaffolding (ESM-only)

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** 628c1de (impl: 0272fe3, fixes: 628c1de)
**Agent:** scaffolder
**Summary:** Bootstrapped npm workspace root + `packages/middleware` as ESM-only TypeScript package per spec. Established TypeScript strict (noUncheckedIndexedAccess, exactOptionalPropertyTypes, verbatimModuleSyntax), tsup ESM-only build (target node20, dts on, minify off), Husky v9 + gitleaks pre-commit (middleware lint scope only), and full devDep set (tsup, typescript, tsx, vitest, ajv, pino, winston in middleware; vitest at root) so T6+ can land tests without further `npm install`. Pin invariant: `--passWithNoTests` flag retained in `test`/`test:e2e` until T6 lands first vitest test, documented via `"//test"` sibling key. esbuild force-pinned to ^0.28.1 via root `overrides` to close GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr (HIGH).
**Deviations:** None from task spec. Two security findings from auditor accepted as documented limitations: (a) vitest stays at ^1.5.0 (task spec pin); upgrade to ^3.2.6 to clear GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp is a major migration scoped outside Task 1 — sibling `//audit-vitest` key in middleware scripts forbids `vitest --ui` until upgrade; (b) `prepublishOnly` guard added in middleware (not in original spec) — fail-fast against accidental publish before Task 16. Added `**/tsup.config.ts` to ESLint ignorePatterns (build tooling, not in tsconfig include) — infra-reviewer marked as correct pragmatic call. `.gitignore` updated to also include `.npmrc` (security-auditor SA-T1-03) and `.husky/_/` (husky v9 shim dir).

**Reviews:**

*Round 1:*
- code-reviewer-t1: approved_with_minors (2 minor findings) → [logs/working/task-1/code-reviewer-t1-round1.json](logs/working/task-1/code-reviewer-t1-round1.json)
- security-auditor-t1: conditional_pass (2 medium, 2 low, 2 info findings) → [logs/working/task-1/security-auditor-round1.json](logs/working/task-1/security-auditor-round1.json)
- infrastructure-reviewer-t1: APPROVED (1 advisory, no action) → [logs/working/task-1/infrastructure-reviewer-t1-round1.json](logs/working/task-1/infrastructure-reviewer-t1-round1.json)

*Round 2 (after fixes):*
- code-reviewer-t1: approved (unconditional) → [logs/working/task-1/code-reviewer-t1-round2.json](logs/working/task-1/code-reviewer-t1-round2.json)
- security-auditor-t1: pass → [logs/working/task-1/security-auditor-round2.json](logs/working/task-1/security-auditor-round2.json)
- infrastructure-reviewer-t1: no new findings, round 1 APPROVED stands (no round 2 report file written by reviewer per their preference)

**Verification:**
- `npm install` → success (node 20.19.1, npm 10.8.2); lockfile created
- `npm run lint` → exit 0
- `npm run --workspace=packages/middleware typecheck` → exit 0
- `npm run build --workspace=packages/middleware` → dist/index.js + dist/index.d.ts + dist/index.js.map present
- `npm test --workspace=@universal-paywall/middleware` → exit 0 (vitest 1.6.1, --passWithNoTests)
- `npx vitest --version` from root → 1.6.1
- `npm ls esbuild` → all consumers deduped to 0.28.1 (overrides active)
- gitleaks PEM-key surrogate test → exit 1 (hook blocks correctly)

**Open items for future tasks:**
- T6 implementer: if `ajv` is used in production `src/` code (not just tests), promote from devDependencies to dependencies (code-reviewer T1-M2).
- Pre-MVP: upgrade vitest to ^3.2.6 to clear GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp; until then, no `vitest --ui` invocations (enforced by `//audit-vitest` sibling key).
- CI task (separate from T1): add gitleaks as a server-side gate to defend against local `HUSKY=0` / `--no-verify` bypass (security-auditor SA-T1-06).
